# Annotation Guidelines

The purpose of the annotation is to distinguish formulaic part from non-formulaic part in each expression. Formulaic expressions are supposed to be suggested by writing assistance systems, and thus expressions that are not helpful in writing should be excluded.

## Guideline

1. Formulaic part must express the meanings of a category it belongs to.
2. Words that are not needed to express the meanings of the category should be excluded.
3. Adverbs and adjectives can be included if they just emphasize the meaning of the formulaic expression.
4. Prepositions can be included if necessary.
5. Nouns can be included if the nouns are so frequently used in many papers that they can be formulaic. E.g. "research", "data" or "paper"
6. Too specific expressions are not to be included.
7. Placeholders should be excluded.
8. Too short formulaic expressions are of no use. Exclude them.

## Examples

* CATEGORY: Establishing the importance of the topic for the world or society
  * `X is fundamental to ...`: `X` is a place holder. `is fundamental` shows the importance. `to` is needed to express "for the world or society". `...` is a placeholder. Therefore, formulaic part is `is fundamental to`.

* CATEGORY: Describing the process: other phrases expression purpose
  * `For the attitude questions, a Likert scale was used.`: `For` is needed to express the purpose. `the attitude questions` is too specific. `a Likert scale was used` is a process itself, so it is too specific. After all, only `For` is formulaic part.

* CATEGORY: Describing the process: statistical procedures
  * `The data were normalised using ...`: `The data` is a common noun. `normalised` is needed because it shows a statistical way. `using` corresponds to procedures. Therefore, `the data were normalised using` is formulaic part.
